STUDENTS PLACEMENT PERCENTAGE

This report depicts only the basic logic of the software developed along with flowchart so that any reader can understand the logic of the software.
However, the implicate have not been included in the report.
Placement of students is one of the very important activities in educational institutions. 
Admission and reputation of institutions mainly depends on placements. 
Hence all institutions strive to strengthen placement department.
A model is proposed along with an algorithm to predict the placement chance of students.
This system is compared with other classification algorithms such as Naive bayes, Decision tree, and Neural network with respect to accuracy, precision and recall. 
From the results obtained it is found that the proposed algorithm predicts better in comparison with other algorithms.
An educational institution contains a large number of student records. 
This data is a prosperity of information, but is too large for any one person to understand in its entirety. 
Hence there is a need for identifying those students among the whole set of students who have good knowledge, skill and attitude score and finding placement chance for them would help us achieve the objective and thus save lot of time.
